Hi Martin. I was unsure how you wanted us to inform you of the 'deeper understanding' we achieved so I list them here as well as partially within the app

use of Materialize CSS framework. 
Use of ProBooleans in models
Use of modifiers such as pro optimizer, massfx rigid body, and others. 
Use of arrays to create multiple objects along path (done with the helmet model)
Ability to change material of models via Javascript
Also use of a database if that comes under it
